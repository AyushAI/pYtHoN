# following code print the different data types of the variables

print(type(z)) # string type
print(type(a)) # integer type
print(type(b)) # boolean type
print(type(c)) # float type
print(type(d)) # string type
print(type(e)) # complex type
print(type(f)) # None type

# some advance data types in python

print(type(list)) # list type and it is mutable can have duplicate values
print(type(tuple)) # tuple type and it is immutable can have duplicate values
print(type(dictionary)) # dictionary type and it is mutable can have duplicate values

# intresting thing about Python is everything is just object creation
